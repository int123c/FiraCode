## Fira Code: monospaced font with programming ligatures

In this fork, the line height of Fira Code is increased to match the fallback Chinese font (by messing around with some parameters), so line height will not change in Xcode when you try to mix those charaters in the same line. Also `?.` is removed because it makes no sense in Swift.
